# Welcome to *AdFlush*

Document for paper *AdFlush: A Real-World Deployable Machine Learning Solution for Effective Advertisement and Web Tracker Prevention*, accepted to the Web Conference 2024, Singapore. 

*AdFlush* is the first advertisement and web tracker blocking Chrome Extension based on Machine Learning prediction. With thorough feature engineering process considering state-of-the-art methodology, *AdFlush* takes advantage of its lightweight and powerful classification ability to detect and block advertisement and web trackers preserving user privacy in the same time. Please refer to our paper for details of the framework and evaluation results of *AdFlush*.

# Abstract
Conventional ad blocking and tracking prevention tools often fall short in addressing web content manipulation. Machine learning approaches have been proposed to enhance detection accuracy, yet aspects of practical deployment have frequently been overlooked. This paper introduces AdFlush, a novel machine learning model for real-world browsers. To develop AdFlush, we evaluated the effectiveness of 883 features, ultimately selecting 27 key features for optimal performance. We tested AdFlush on a dataset of 10,000 real-world websites, achieving an F1 score of 0.98, thereby outperforming AdGraph (F1 score: 0.93), WebGraph (F1 score: 0.90), and WTAgraph (F1 score: 0.84). Additionally, AdFlush significantly reduces computational overhead, requiring 56% less CPU and 80% less memory than AdGraph. We also assessed AdFlushâ€™s robustness against adversarial manipulations, demonstrating superior resilience with F1 scores ranging from 0.89 to 0.98, surpassing the performance of AdGraph and WebGraph, which recorded F1 scores between 0.81 and 0.87. A six-month longitudinal study confirmed that AdFlush maintains a high F1 score above 0.97 without the need for retraining, underscoring its effectiveness.

The demo of exploring real-life web sites and detecting, blocking advertisements and trackers using *AdFlush* is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzdfqpiCjKg">here</a>.

# **Preparing *AdFlush***

We recommend you to take advantage of our fully build Docker image to explore several processes and results of *AdFlush*. If not available, you can make yourself an environment to match *AdFlush*'s settings.
- A. ***(Recommended)*** Pull our Docker image and simply run the fully built container
- B. *(Alternative of A.)* Make a python environment from scratch
- C. *(Optional)* Simple steps to setup a Docker image of *AdFlush*

## A. Within Docker Image

### 1. Pull the Docker image
Run the following codes to pull the Docker image of *AdFlush* and start a container. 

```bash
$ apt-get install Docker.io
$ docker pull chaejinlim98330/adflush:artifact.v2
```
- If you encounter an error saying `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?.`, see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44678725/cannot-connect-to-the-docker-daemon-at-unix-var-run-docker-sock-is-the-docker">here</a> and run the command corresponding to your OS to start your Docker daemon.

### 2. Start the Docker container
On first run: 
```bash
$ docker run -it --name adflush_con chaejinlim98330/adflush:artifact.v2
```
On post runs:
```bash
$ docker start -i adflush_con
```

### 3. Start python venv
```bash
container $ source adflushenv/bin/activate
(adflushenv) container $ cd source
```

### *(When closing AdFlush)*
To exit the docker container:
```bash

```

## B. Within Python Environment

### 0. Prerequisites
1. This study has been run and tested in *Python==3.7.17*, in both following environments:
- *javac=17.0.7*, *Windows 10 Pro 22H2*
- *openjdk==11.0.19*, *Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS (Bionic Beaver)*

A package used by *AdFlush*, H2O requires 64-bit JDK of versions over 7. You can download Java as the same version as tested from <a href="https://www.oracle.com/kr/java/technologies/javase/javase8u211-later-archive-downloads.html">here</a>. 

2. The git repository requires Git LFS (Large File Storage). If you do not have LFS, download it from <a href="https://git-lfs.com/">here</a>.

### 1.  Clone Repository
Setup the directory structure as it is the same as this GitHub repository. 

1. Move to the directory you want to import *AdFlush*.  
```bash
$ cd path/to/working/directory
```

2. Within the directory, run the following source codes.  
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/SKKU-SecLab/AdFlush.git
$ git lfs pull
$ cd AdFlush
``` 

### 2. Python Venv
Build a python environment

```bash
$ python3 -m venv adflushenv
$ source adflushenv/bin/activate
(adflushenv) $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
(adflushenv) $ cd source
```

### 3. Prepare Dataset
Download the `all_df_883_train.csv` .csv file from <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10673857">here</a> to the directory `/path/to/working/directory/adflush/dataset`. 
You can see the proper location marked with `all_df_883_train.placeholder`.

## C. ***(Optional)*** Setup a Docker image of *AdFlush*

Run the following code to build a Docker image as the same steps of *AdFlush*. 
The saame codes are writtin in the comments of `/AdFlush/Dockerfile`. 
You can see the steps of building *Adflush*'s Docker image. 

```bash
$ docker build --tag adflush:custom.v1
$ docker run -it adflush:custom.v1
container $ apt-get install libbz2-dev liblzma-dev lzma zlib1g-dev
container $ npm init -y
container $ npm install fs acorn-loose
container $ tar -xvzf Python-3.7.17.tgz
container $ cd Python-3.7.17
container $ ./configure
container $ make altinstall
container $ cd /adflush
container $ python3.7 -m venv adflushenv
container $ source adflushenv/bin/activate
container $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
container $ pip install requests tabulate future
container $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# **1. Exploring the processes of *AdFlush***

Run the code `python main.py -p [your options]` to follow processes and explore results of *AdFlush*. Available options are as below. Note that the process `performance-eval` requires the arguments -d {dataset} and -m {model}, and `train-gan` requires the argument -s {subset}. 

```bash
usage: main.py [-h] -p
               {feature-eng,model-sel,performance-eval,train-gan,extract-new-feat}
               [-d {testset,gan,gnirts,javascript-obfuscator,wobfuscator}]
               [-m {mojo,onnx,custom_mojo,custom_onnx}]
               [-s {adflush,webgraph,adgraph}]

Run AdFlush Experiments

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p {feature-eng,model-sel,performance-eval,train-gan,extract-new-feat}
                        Experiment process you want to run
  -d {testset,gan,gnirts,javascript-obfuscator,wobfuscator,custom-gan}
                        Specify dataset during 'performance-eval'
  -m {mojo,onnx,custom_mojo,custom_onnx}
                        Specify model during 'performance-eval' *For custom,
                        follow model-sel process first.
  -s {adflush,webgraph,adgraph}
                        Specify model during 'train-gan'
```

## 1. Feature Enginnering Framework of AdFlush

Run `python main.py -p feature-eng` to follow the steps and reproduce the results of *AdFlush*'s feature engineering framework. The contents are:
1. Point-Biserial Correlation
2. *RFECV(Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation) Existing Features / New Robust Features
3. Pearson & Spearman
4. RFI-PI mean Importance

You can also see the results of RFECV in figures in `/adflush/output`. To fetch the figures from the docker container, run the following codes in another terminal. 

```bash
$ docker cp adflush_con:/adflush/output /path/to/fetch/figures/
```

* ***RFECV process requires many hours, and the entire 'feature-eng' process might run over a day.***


## 2. Modeling AdFlush

Run `python main.py -p model-sel` and follow the steps to reproduce the model of *AdFlush* upon various datasets. The newly trained *AdFlush* is saved in `/adflush/model/`, where the mojo model is `AdFlush_custom/(name_of_model)` and the ONNX model is `AdFlush_custom.onnx`. 

After running this process, you can evaluate your custom *AdFlush* model by setting the `-m` argument as `custom_mojo` or `custom_onnx` in [3. Performance Evaluation](#performance_eval).

- We must note that the results of the source code may differ from the results in our paper. The ONNX convertion involves compatibility within multiple environments, nessecary for browser extension implementation. However in this way the limit of Opsets in conversion might act as an upperbound in model performance by degrading precise floating point computation.

## 3. Performance Evaluation <a name="performance_eval"></a>

Run the following code to reproduce the performance evaluation of *AdFlush*. 
```bash
(adflushenv) container $ python main.py -p performance-eval -m {model} -d {dataset}
```
Samples of running performance evaluation are below:
```bash
(adflushenv) container $ python main.py -p performance-eval -m mojo -d testset

## 4. Generate GAN mutated datasets
Run `python main.py -p train-gan -s {subset}` to train a new GAN as the robustness evaluation of *AdFlush* and create a custom mutated dataset. 

The output of the code will generate a mutated dataset from the newly trained GAN as `GAN_custom_mutated_{subset}.csv`. You can also use the mutated dataset to evaluate performance of *AdFlush* with the `-d` argument as `custom-gan` [here](#performance_eval). 

## 5. Encodings used in *AdFlush*
The details of encodings used in *AdFlush* are implemented in `/adflush/source/adflush_encodings.py`.

- `trainCharEmbeddings`: Train a custom character embedding dictionary using <a href=https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html>Word2Vec</a>. 
- `char2vec_pretrained`: Embed a url with *AdFlush*'s pretrained character embedding dictionaries.
- `extract_JS_Features`: Extract robust features as implemented in *AdFlush*. 
    - input: file name of HTML or JavaScript source code. Place the file within `/adflush/source/processing/` directory for proper use.

By running the following code, you can see samples of results of extracting robust features from actual JavaScript and HTML source codes. 

```bash
(adflushenv) container $ python main.py -p extract-new-feat

# **3. Dataset**

We opensource our *AdFlush* dataset used within our study. Our dataset consists of top 10K web pages from Tranco list, crawled at the date April 4, 2023. We divided our dataset for training processes and evaluation by 8:2 ratio. We also provide the datasets obtained with our trained GAN or several JavaScript obfuscation and used in robustness evaluation. 
These are available in `./dataset` directory. The identical dataset is also provided <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10673857">here</a> via Zenodo. 
- `AdFlush_train.csv`: Train set of *AdFlush*
- `AdFlush_test.csv`: Test set of *AdFlush*
- `all_df_883_`: Dataset collected by extracting all possible 883 features
- `GAN_mutated_` : GAN mutated test sets for each method
- `JS_obfuscated_`: JavaScript features obtained by each obfuscation method for *AdFlush*

(Optional) We collected our dataset from OpenWPM. To run all tasks (Graph building, Feature extraction or Classification) on WebGraph and AdGraph, the crawl data used is collected using a custom version of [OpenWPM](https://github.com/sandrasiby/OpenWPM/tree/webgraph). Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/sandrasiby/OpenWPM/tree/webgraph#readme) to setup OpenWPM in your environment.
